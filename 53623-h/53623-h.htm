<span class="i0">Fierce Neptune’s daughter, beneath the water,<br /></span>
<span class="i4">In grottoes cool dwelt I,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And, laughing, hid in the seashell’s lid,<br /></span>
<span class="i4">As fishes arrowed by.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">My feet were free to the undersea;<br /></span>
<span class="i4">I played amidst its gloom,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And in the deep where the mermaids weep<br /></span>
<span class="i4">Above the hero’s tomb,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Where the sea snake strips dainty maiden lips<br /></span>
<span class="i4">Of kisses once so warm,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And the lifeless child, by the eddies wild,<br /></span>
<span class="i4">Is torn from the mother’s arm.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The foam-browed billow my head would pillow<br /></span>
<span class="i4">Upon its bosom fair,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">While the restless sweep of the moon-led deep<br /></span>
<span class="i4">Would drift us here and there.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I oft would float in the dainty boat<br /></span>
<span class="i4">The Nautilus oared for me,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Out, far, far out, where a noisy rout<br /></span>
<span class="i4">Of breakers leapt in glee;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Or further urge to the world’s dim verge,<br /></span>
<span class="i4">Where heaven meets the wave,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And the seagull’s wing was the only thing<br /></span>
<span class="i4">To follow us was brave.<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_2" id="page_2"></a>{2}</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then called by the blast, as it glided past,<br /></span>
<span class="i4">I would turn and clap my hands,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As the waves were tossed on the tropic coast,<br /></span>
<span class="i4">And furrowed the silver sands.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Where, with weedy locks, the bare limbed rocks<br /></span>
<span class="i4">Bend over the foaming sea,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I oft resorted, and, as I sported,<br /></span>
<span class="i4">The sunbeams played with me.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">We would dance all day in the prismed spray,<br /></span>
<span class="i4">Or in the blossoms hide,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That, trembling, clung to the crags and hung<br /></span>
<span class="i4">Above the boiling tide.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Oftimes the cool, green depths of a pool<br /></span>
<span class="i4">Would lure me down to rest,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Till the sunbeams came in a path of flame<br /></span>
<span class="i4">And found me in my nest.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With colors gaily they decked me daily,<br /></span>
<span class="i4">And tempted me to fly<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Afar from the foam of my ocean home<br /></span>
<span class="i4">Aloft in the cloudless sky.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But I said them nay, for the leaping spray,<br /></span>
<span class="i4">And cool, green depths of sea,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Than the flight of birds and the sunbeams’ words<br /></span>
<span class="i4">Were dearer far to me.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">“I had seen,” I said, “to the sky o’erhead<br /></span>
<span class="i4">My sisters, laughing, soar<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For a merry flight through the azure bright,<br /></span>
<span class="i4">And never saw them more.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I love my home in the ocean foam,<br /></span>
<span class="i4">I love the moonlit sands,<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_3" id="page_3"></a>{3}</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">And I would sigh in the depths of sky<br /></span>

<span class="i4">Through autumn’s golden air,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A yearning came that I could not name,<br /></span>
<span class="i4">Stronger than my despair.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">“If I must live on when my love is gone,”<br /></span>
<span class="i4">I murmured to my soul,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">“Oh, let it be by the throbbing sea<br /></span>
<span class="i4">My sisters make their goal.<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Sweeps merrily down the white road, and is gone.<br /></span>
<span class="i4">Then silence returns, till the winds howl in glee,<br /></span>
<span class="i4">Or some frost-riven tree<br /></span>

property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a

Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
